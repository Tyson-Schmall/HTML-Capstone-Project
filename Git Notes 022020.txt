GIT FUNDAMENTALS

GIT DEFINITION - IT IS A FREE AND OPEN SOURCE DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM. (BREAKDOWN OF EACH KEYWORD AND DEFINITIONS OF EACH, ARE LISTED BELOW)

'OPEN SOURCE, DISTRIBUTED, VERSION CONTROL - WHAT IS IT/HOW TO USE IN APPS?

OPEN SOURCE: FREE TO USE AND DEVELOPED BY A COMMUNITY OF DEVELOPERS. 

'DISTRIBUTED' - CENTRALIZED CODE REPOSITORY. NOT JUST FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL, BUT FOR TEAM PROJECTS AS WELL. IN MOST LARGE APP SCENARIOS, WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON A TEAM, WITH A SINGLE CODEBASE, BEING WORKED ON BY EVERYBODY ON THE TEAM SIMULTANEOUSLY.

EACH DIAMOND REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE CODE. THE DIAMOND IS THE MASTER COPY OF THE APP/SITE/PROGRAM WE ARE BUILDING. EACH TIME THE LINE BREAKS, (ONCE ABOVE AND ONCE BELOW IN THE DIAGRAM), IT REPRESENTS A DEVELOPER TAKING ON A TASK AND MANIPULATING
A COPY OF THE MASTER. THE MASTER IS THEN UPDATED AND PATCHED ONCE ALL BUGS ARE SITUATED AND WORKED OUT. 

tHE STRAIGHT LINE REPRESENSTS THE CENTRALIZED CODE REPOSITORY THE ENTIRE TEAM HAS ACCESS TO.

AS A MEMBER OF THE PROJECT, WE CAN WORK ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS WHILE OTHER PEOPLE WORK ON THEIRS. SEE GUIDE 1515 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND DETGAIL ON THIS SITUATION/INFORMATION. 

'VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM OR VCS' - GIVES ABILITY TO CREATE MILESTONES FOR A PROJECT. SEE BELOW. THIS ALLOWS US TO TELL THE CODE TO RETURN BACK TO ONE OF IT'S PREVIOUS VERSIONS. THEREFORE, EACH VERSION IS SAVED.
